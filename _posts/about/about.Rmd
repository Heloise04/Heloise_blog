Hi, 

I'm Héloïse Plasman, I'm in second grade in Biology in the Univerty of Mons in Belgium. My English teacher this year is Bénédicte Bouchet, I'm in group 4. 

I aways like Sciences in general since a long time. That's why I was already studying Sciences in secondary school. 

I have also had English courses since I was in kinder garden because I was in a immersion school. 


Besides studies my big passion is pastry and cooking in general. It helps me destress.

Academic year  2020-2021
