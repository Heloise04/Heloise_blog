Hi, 
I'm Héloïse Plasman, I'm in 2^nd grade in Biology in the Univerty of Mons in Belgium. 
I aways like Sciences in general since a long time. That's why I was already studying Sciences in secondary school. 
I have also had English courses since I was in kinder garden because I was in a immersion school. 

Besides studies my big passion is pastry and cooking in general. It helps me destress.
